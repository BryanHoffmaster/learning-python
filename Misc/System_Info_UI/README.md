This is a little test file I'm working on to display OS system info.

Goals:

1. OS agnostic, so that it can be ran on any OS.
2. Sectioned off/ Tabbed  , tiered designed for different areas of the system info,
   sort of like windows management console.
3. Colored options, possibly.
4. Expandable/collapsable trees for tabs
